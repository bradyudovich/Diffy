    For every code change, you must review README.md and ensure it accurately reflects
    any new features, bug fixes, or behavioral changes introduced by the change.
    If the README.md does not accurately reflect the current state of the codebase,
    you must propose specific, actionable updates to README.md before completing the task.
    Check for discrepancies such as outdated feature descriptions, missing new features,
    incorrect usage instructions, or undocumented behavioral changes, and prompt the user
    with a clear proposed README.md update whenever any such discrepancy is found.
