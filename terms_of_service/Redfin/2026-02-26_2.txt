2.13.9.
Dispute Resolution
.
THIS SECTION 2.13.9 APPLIES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IS VOID WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of the Agreement.
2.13.9.1.
Informal Negotiations
.
To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of a Claim, you and the applicable Redfin Company agree to first attempt to negotiate any Claim (except those Claims expressly excluded below) informally for at least sixty (60) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice.
You must provide written notice by sending a written description of your claim signed by you personally to the applicable Redfin Company at this address by certified mail: 1099 Stewart St, Suite 600, Seattle, WA 98101
The Notice of Dispute must contain enough information for us to identify all relationship(s) that you have with Redfin and attempt to resolve your claim, including (a) your name; (b) the email address(es) that you use when communicating with or using the Redfin services; (c) your mobile telephone number; (d) your state of residence; (e) a written description of the issues, and supporting information; and (f) a good faith calculation of the damages you claim to have suffered and a statement of the specific relief you are seeking. You may be represented by an attorney or other person in that process.
Your address for such notices is your personal home address, if provided by you, with an email copy to the email address you may have provided to such Redfin Company.
You and Redfin each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. You agree that you may not commence any arbitration or court proceeding unless you and we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description and you have made a good faith effort to resolve your claim directly with us during that time. If we are unable to resolve your claim within 60 days despite those good faith efforts, then either you or Redfin may start an arbitration or small claims court proceeding.
2.13.9.2.
Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
.
Subject to Section 2.13.9.3, you and the Redfin Companies agree that any Claim between you and any Redfin Company or Redfin Companies will be resolved
solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.
This Section 2.13.9 is governed, in all respects, both procedurally and substantively, by the United States Federal Arbitration Act. You and the applicable Redfin Companies agree that you are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
YOU AND EACH REDFIN COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties' Claim is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding (the two foregoing sentences shall constitute the "
Class Action Waiver
". If this Class Action Waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 2.13.9 shall be null and void.
SUBJECT TO THE ABOVE THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN REGARD TO CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT.
If any other provision of this Section 2.13.9 requiring that Claims be brought only on an individual basis and not on a class, collective, or representative basis, is determined to be invalid or unenforceable with respect to any particular Claim, including any remedy or request for relief, then that particular Claim, remedy or request for relief shall not proceed in arbitration but rather will be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction subject to Section 2.13.8. If that happens, however, the arbitration provisions in this Section 2.13.9 will still be fully enforceable as to all other Claims, which must be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis. Any arbitrable Claims will be resolved before non-arbitrable Claims, which the parties will jointly request to be stayed pending the conclusion of arbitration. In any subsequent litigation of non-arbitrable claims, the arbitrator’s factual findings will not be entitled to deference by the court.
2.13.9.3.
Exceptions and Opt-Out
. Nothing in this Section 2.13.9 precludes any party from filing or participating in administrative proceedings before state, provincial/territorial, or federal agencies to address alleged violations of law enforced by those agencies. Further, to the extent a party would have to file a timely administrative charge or complaint as a prerequisite to filing a Claim in court, the party must do the same before submitting a Claim to arbitration under this Agreement. Upon receipt of a right-to-sue letter or similar administrative determination, however, the Claim can only be resolved in individual arbitration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
This Section 2.13.9 also does not prevent any party from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction for any interim or provisional relief available under the law that is necessary to protect the rights of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal. This Section 2.13.9 further does not prevent any party from filing any Claim that otherwise qualifies in small claims court on an individual basis.
In addition,
you have the right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Claim
if you provide the Redfin Company with whom you are entering into this Agreement with personally signed, written notice of your desire to do so by email at
legal@redfin.com
or by a personally signed written notice sent by certified mail to Redfin at 1099 Stewart Street, Suite 600, Seattle, WA 98101, within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to this Agreement.
2.13.9.4.
Equitable Remedies
.
Except for individual Claims brought in small claims court, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any Claim asserted by you or the Redfin Companies, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual Claim. To the extent that you or the Redfin Companies prevail on a Claim in arbitration and seek injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public, the entitlement and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, subject to Section 2.13.8 and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual Claims in arbitration.
2.13.9.5.
Rules and Logistics Governing Arbitration
. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under its AAA Rules then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at
www.adr.org
or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at
www.adr.org
.
If your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video-conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
Any evidence introduced or produced in connection with the arbitral proceeding may only be used in that AAA proceeding, and may not be disclosed or used for any other purpose, including any other arbitration of similar claims.
2.13.9.6.
Arbitration Costs
. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. If you initiate an arbitration, you are required to pay AAA’s initial filing fee, but the applicable Redfin Company will reimburse you for this filing fee at the conclusion of the arbitration if that filing exceeds the fee for filing a complaint in a federal or state court in your county of residence. If the arbitrator finds that your claim was brought for an improper purpose (as per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) standards) or that your claim or the relief sought by it was frivolous, then will not reimburse your filing fee and we may seek an award of our legal fees or costs against you and/or your counsel. This Agreement authorizes the arbitrator to award fees or other sanctions against your counsel.
2.13.9.7.
Delivery of Demand for Arbitration
. A demand for arbitration must be in writing and delivered by hand or first-class mail to the other party within the applicable statute of limitations period. Any demand for arbitration shall be provided to the applicable Redfin Company pursuant to Section 2.13.2. Any demand for arbitration made by a Redfin Company shall be provided to the last address on file with the Redfin Company. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration.
2.13.9.8.
Effect of Changes on Arbitration
. Notwithstanding Section 2.13.3 above, if we make any future changes to this Section 2.13.9 (other than a change to our contact information), you may reject any such change by sending an email at
legal@redfin.com
or by a personally signed written notice sent by certified mail to Redfin at 1099 Stewart Street, Suite 600, Seattle, WA 98101 within thirty (30) days of the change. This written notice does not constitute an opt out of arbitration altogether. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Claim between you and Redfin in accordance with the latest in time version of Section 2.13.9 that you did not effectively reject.
2.13.10.
No Injunctive Relief
. In no event shall you seek or be entitled to rescission, injunctive or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain the operation of the Services.
2.13.11.
Entire Agreement
. You agree that this Agreement constitutes the entire, complete, and exclusive agreement between you and each Company regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or receive certain Services, which are reflected in the applicable Services Addendum or otherwise communicated to you by the applicable Redfin Company. Without limiting the foregoing, if you enter into a Redfin Agent Agreement, that Redfin Agent Agreement may incorporate the terms of this Agreement by reference. To the extent the terms of a Redfin Agent Agreement conflict with this Agreement, the terms of the Redfin Agent Agreement shall control, with the exception of Section 2.13.9 of this Agreement, which shall control in all instances.

Additional Grant of Patent Rights Version 2
"Software" means the Stetho software distributed by Facebook, Inc
Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook") hereby grants to each recipient of the Software ("you") a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable (subject to the termination provision below) license under any Necessary Claims, to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software. For avoidance of doubt, no license is granted under Facebook’s rights in any patent claims that are infringed by (i) modifications to the Software made by you or any third party or (ii) the Software in combination with any software or other technology.
The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice, if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent Assertion: (i) against Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, (ii) against any party if such Patent Assertion arises in whole or in part from any software, technology, product or service of Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, or (iii) against any party relating to the Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates files a lawsuit alleging patent infringement against you in the first instance, and you respond by filing a patent infringement counterclaim in that lawsuit against that party that is unrelated to the Software, the license granted hereunder will not terminate under section (i) of this paragraph due to such counterclaim.
A "Necessary Claim" is a claim of a patent owned by Facebook that is necessarily infringed by the Software standing alone.
A "Patent Assertion" is any lawsuit or other action alleging direct, indirect, or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe any patent, including a cross-claim or counterclaim.

2.9. MLS® Terms of Use. Before we can show you pictures and prices of sold homes, or show you comments on active listings from Redfin Agents, our MLS data providers require you to acknowledge that you consider Redfin to be your real estate agent, broker or salesperson. For purposes of clarification, talking to a Redfin Agent generally about listings or home sales comps does not create an obligation to work with a Redfin Agent to buy or sell a home. However, you are required to enter into a Redfin Agent Agreement and become a Redfin Client before you can list your home or buy a home using the services of a Redfin Agent. Before proceeding to view the content made available through the Redfin Services, you must acknowledge all of the following:
2.9.1. You are entering into a lawful consumer-broker, seller/buyer-brokerage, or similar relationship with Redfin (as defined by applicable state or provincial/territorial law).

Any information you obtain from the Redfin website is intended for your personal, non-commercial use.
2.9.2. You have a bona fide interest in the purchase, sale, or lease of real estate on the Redfin Sites.
2.9.3. You will not copy, redistribute, or retransmit any of the information provided except in connection with your consideration of the purchase or sale of an individual property.
2.9.4. You will not, directly or indirectly, display, post, disseminate, distribute, publish, broadcast, transfer, sell, or sublicense, any information provided through the Services to another individual or entity. This prohibition expressly includes "scraping" (including screen and database scraping), "data mining", or any other activity intended to collect, store, re-organize, summarize, or manipulate any information provided or any related data.
2.9.5. You acknowledge that the individual MLS® that supplies the listing data is the owner of such data and you acknowledge the validity of the MLS®'s system, and MLS®'s proprietary rights and copyright to such data and any related data.
2.9.6. Redfin also explicitly authorizes MLS® employees, MLS® members, or their duly authorized representatives to access Redfin's website for the purposes of verifying compliance with MLS® rules and monitoring the display of participants' listings on Redfin's site.
2.9.7.
