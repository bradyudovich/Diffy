Input
") together with the responses those interfaces generate ("
Output
"). Except with respect to TikTok Content and unless expressly stated otherwise, as between you and TikTok USDS Joint Venture, you own Your Content.
Due to the nature of generative AI, output may not be unique to a specific user, and your ownership of Output does not extend to other users' output.
If you choose to submit comments, ideas, or feedback to us, you give us permission to use them in connection with the Platform and any other services that we choose, for any purpose, without any restriction or compensation to you. You agree that we do not have to consider or act on them, return them, or keep them confidential. We will own all rights in anything we develop based on your comments, ideas, or feedback.
You represent and warrant that you have, and will continue to have, all necessary rights in and to Your Content, including licenses, consents, and permissions necessary to create, post, input, and distribute Your Content on the Platform. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes any music that you use which was not selected from the TikTok music library; learn more
here
.
Separately, we may make certain content available on the Platform for you to use in accordance with these Terms, including images, designs, videos, filters, text, music, or sounds (“
TikTok Content
”). We, or the rights holders of such content that let us provide it to you, retain all rights in and to the TikTok Content.
To provide the Platform, we need certain rights from you (called a license).
By creating, inputting, publishing, and otherwise providing Your Content on or to the Platform, you grant to TikTok USDS Joint Venture a license to use Your Content that is:
non-exclusive, irrevocable, and royalty-free (you retain the rights to use Your Content elsewhere, although we don't owe you any payments for sharing Your Content with us)
assignable and sub-licensable, including through multiple tiers (so we can, for example, work with service providers and business partners to help distribute Your Content); and
worldwide (so we can show your content to a global audience).
Our license to use Your Content includes our rights to access, reproduce (e.g. to copy), distribute, share, download, adapt or make derivative works (e.g. to translate and/or create captions), perform, and communicate Your Content to the public (e.g. to display it),
for the purposes of operating, improving, and providing the Platform and developing new technologies (including training, testing, and improving our machine learning models and algorithms) and services for TikTok USDS Joint Venture and our service providers and business partners, consistent with these Terms and subject to your Platform settings.
Depending on your Platform usage, including your sharing activities and settings, you also grant to each user of the Platform a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable, worldwide license to use Your Content, including to access, reproduce (e.g. to copy), distribute, share, download, adapt or make derivative works (e.g. to include Your Content in their content), perform, and communicate Your Content to the public (e.g. to display it), in accordance with these Terms.
We retain all our respective rights, title, and interest, including intellectual property and other proprietary rights, in and to the Platform, including its generative AI-enabled features, and we reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms.
In short: When you create, import, upload, publish, or generate content to the Platform, it remains yours, but you grant us a license to use Your Content to operate, develop, improve, and provide the Platform, and to develop new technologies. If you choose to make Your Content available to others, we can show it to other users and those other users may be able to use Your Content too. We retain all our respective rights in and to the Platform and our technologies.
3.6 Removing or restricting Your Content
It is important that you understand the following with respect to the content that you create, post or share on the Platform:
We may remove or restrict access to any content, including yours, whether publicly or privately posted, for any reason, including if (a) it violates these Terms, our
Community Guidelines
, or other conditions or policies, (b) it may cause harm to, or violate the rights of, our users, TikTok USDS Joint Venture, our affiliates, or other third parties, or (c) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or court order, or are permitted to do so by law. Our
Community Guidelines
further describe why content might be removed or restricted on the Platform.
You can delete specific videos from the Platform at any time, or all of Your Content by deleting your account as described in Section 5 “Suspending or ending our relationship.” We will no longer publicly display your deleted content except as provided in Section 3.5 “Ownership of content and grant of licenses” (which explains, for example, that Your Content will remain publicly accessible on the Platform if it has been incorporated into content posted by other users).
In short: We may remove or restrict access to Your Content, and you can delete Your Content, in accordance with this Section and our
Community Guidelines
.

If you post content on the Platform that promotes a third-party brand or its products or services in exchange for payment or any other incentive, you must comply with the
Branded Content Policy
and all applicable laws and guidelines (including with respect to disclosures), including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s Endorsement Guides.
In short:
Where you post about a brand or its products or services in return for payment or any other incentive, then you should read our
Branded Content Policy
and ensure you follow those rules and other
applicable laws and guidelines, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s Endorsement Guides.
3.8 Permissions you give TikTok USDS Joint Venture

To enable these features, you give us permission to use your name, profile image and username, in connection with ads, sponsored gifts, offers, and other branded or sponsored content that you interact with, without any compensation to you, unless we have entered into a separate commercial agreement with you with respect to a specific promotion or advertisement.

4. Limitation of liability
The Platform is provided “as is.” We and our affiliates make no guarantees that the Platform, including its generative AI-enabled features, will be safe, secure, and free from errors, or that it will function without interruption, delay or defect.
To the maximum extent permitted by law: We and TT COMMERCE & GLOBAL SERVICES, ALONG WITH EACH'S AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND ADVISORS, DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, VALIDITY, REGISTRABILITY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE. Users and others are solely responsible for their content and use of the Platform. We are not responsible for users’ and others’ actions or conduct (whether on or off the Platform) and we do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness, or quality, of any content that users and others share on the Platform (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content). You acknowledge that we have no obligation to pre-screen, monitor, review, or edit any content posted by you or other users on the Platform.
In addition to the limitation above, to the maximum extent permitted by law: WE AND TT COMMERCE & GLOBAL SERVICES, ALONG WITH EACH'S AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND ADVISORS, MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF OUR GENERATIVE AI-ENABLED FEATURES AND OUTPUT.

TikTok USDS Joint Venture does not endorse any content included in Output, and Output does not reflect our views, or those of our affiliates or personnel. You are responsible for reviewing, verifying, and deciding how to use Output, and you should not rely on Output as a source of truth or fact, as a substitute for professional advice, or to inform decisions related to e.g., health, finance, or law. Due to the inherent limitations of generative AI, Output you generate may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, objectionable, inappropriate, unlawful, and unfit for a particular purpose, and by using the Platform, including its generative AI-enabled features, you recognize and assume this risk.
EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF:
ANY RELIANCE PLACED BY YOU ON THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY OR EXISTENCE OF ANY ADVERTISING, OR AS A RESULT OF ANY RELATIONSHIP OR TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND ANY ADVERTISER OR SPONSOR WHOSE ADVERTISING APPEARS ON THE PLATFORM,
ANY CHANGES WHICH WE MAY MAKE TO THE SERVICES, OR FOR ANY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION IN THE PROVISION OF THE PLATFORM (OR ANY FEATURES WITHIN THE SERVICES),
YOUR FAILURE TO KEEP YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT DETAILS SECURE AND CONFIDENTIAL,
ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES ON THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO OUTPUT THAT IS INACCURATE, INCOMPLETE, MISLEADING, OBJECTIONABLE, INAPPROPRIATE, UNLAWFUL, OR UNFIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM,
ANY ACTIONS TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN IN RELIANCE ON OUTPUT,
ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PLATFORM,
ANY VIRUSES OR MALICIOUS CODE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE PLATFORM BY ANY THIRD PARTY,
ANY CONTENT WHETHER SUBMITTED BY A USER OR TIKTOK USDS JOINT VENTURE, INCLUDING YOUR USE OF CONTENT, AND/OR

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the maximum aggregate liability of TikTok USDS Joint Venture and our affiliates, service providers and business partners, including TT Commerce & Global Services, and its affiliates, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and advisors, arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Platform shall, under no circumstance, exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past 12 months.
Third-party applications and services.

we are legally required to do so, or
it is necessary in our judgment to respond to a technical or security issue.

If you think we should not have banned or suspended your account, or restricted your access to features of the Platform, you may submit an appeal through the functionalities provided on the Platform and we will review our decision. Learn more
here
.
If we permanently ban your accounts, these Terms (as may be amended) will terminate as an agreement between you and us, except those obligations will remain in place which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms, including the obligations set out in: Section 3.5 “Ownership of content and grant of licenses,” Section 4 “Limitation of liability,” Section 5 "Suspending or ending our relationship," Section 7 “Indemnity,” Section 8 “Resolving disputes,” and Section 9 “Other.” Obligations under applicable legal requirements or court order will also remain in place despite the termination.

You agree to regularly review the Terms to stay informed of the latest changes, and to review the Terms whenever you receive a notice from us that the Terms have been updated. The “Last Updated” date will reflect the effective date of the Terms. If you continue to use the Platform after any updated Terms are in effect, you agree to be bound by the updated Terms. Such Terms supersede all prior versions of the Terms unless a particular provision of the updated Terms states otherwise.
You should print off or save a local copy of the Terms for your records.

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless TikTok USDS Joint Venture and our affiliates, service providers, and business partners, including TT Commerce & Global Services and its affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors from any and all claims, demands, damages, injunctions, orders, awards, settlements, losses, liabilities, liens, encumbrances, causes of action, of every kind and character, costs (including attorneys’ fees and other costs of arbitration, litigation, defense, or settlement), and expenses arising out of or relating to your use of the Platform under these Terms, including a breach of your obligations, representations and warranties under these Terms. This provision and your indemnification obligations will survive any termination of your relationship with TikTok USDS Joint Venture and the expiration or termination of these Terms, by either party.
In short: You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless certain entities and individuals in accordance with the above.
8. Resolving disputes
8.1 Informal resolution process first
If we have a dispute with you relating to or arising out of these Terms or the Platform, regardless of when the dispute may have arisen or accrued, we will first try and resolve it with you amicably. You agree to do the same for us; our parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates; and TT Commerce & Global Services. In this section, (Section 8.1) the terms “TikTok USDS Joint Venture,” “we,” or “us” include TikTok USDS Joint Venture, TT Commerce & Global Services, each of their parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors.
The party raising a dispute will initiate this process by notifying the other. Whichever party receives the notice will have 60 days to respond. If the dispute has not been resolved after the response time has expired, or within 30 days after a response has been issued, whichever is earlier, either party may file legal action against the other. Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be completed before filing any legal action. You, TikTok USDS Joint Venture, and TT Commerce & Global Services agree that you will make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute amicably before either you, TikTok USDS Joint Venture, or TT Commerce & Global Services, along with each's affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and advisors, files any legal action against the other, and that the statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process.
8.2 Exclusive venue
These Terms and any claims, causes of action, of any kind or character, or demand arising out of or relating to the Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any claim, cause of action or dispute, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Platform shall also be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California or the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, regardless of whether the claim, cause of action, or dispute arose prior to your agreement to these Terms. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.
8.3 One year limitation period / limitation on legal
action
YOU AND TIKTOK USDS JOINT VENTURE AGREE THAT YOU MUST INITIATE ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE THAT IS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE PLATFORM.  OTHERWISE, YOU FOREVER WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER, BASED ON SUCH EVENTS OR FACTS, AND SUCH CLAIM(S) OR CAUSE(S) OF ACTION ARE PERMANENTLY BARRED.
In short: We hope we do not get into a dispute but, if we do, there are a couple of ways we can try to resolve it.
9. Other
These Terms and any applicable Additional Terms described above are the whole legal agreement between you and TikTok USDS Joint Venture, govern your use of the Platform and completely replace any prior terms of service between you and TikTok Inc. related to the Platform. Any rights and permissions granted in them, may not be transferred or assigned by you. Our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us without any requirement to notify you or any third party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale or disposition of assets, sale or transfer of equity (whether by direct or indirect ownership) or by operation of law or otherwise.
Our or your failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. If any portion of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the removal of that provision will be done to the minimum extent required to make it enforceable under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue to have full force and effect. It will not be considered a waiver of any provision or right if we or you fail to insist upon or enforce any of these Terms. In these Terms, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to.”
The Platform contains certain open source software. Each item of open source software is subject to its own applicable license terms, which can be found at
