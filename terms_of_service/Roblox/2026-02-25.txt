Additionally, images and videos are evaluated for child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery using PhotoDNA and Google’s Content Safety API. If flagged by these systems, the content is sent to trained agents to verify. If the content is confirmed to be CSEA content, this content is reported to the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
