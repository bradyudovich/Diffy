- **Data Sharing with Google**: Users must accept Google’s Terms of Service when using Fitbit with a Google account, raising concerns about data sharing and privacy under Google's broader data practices.

- **Broad Data Collection**: The Terms state that Fitbit can collect and use user information as outlined in their Privacy Policy, which may include sensitive health data, without specifying the extent or purpose of this data collection.

- **User-Generated Content Rights**: By posting content, users grant Fitbit a broad license to use their content, including personal identifiers, which could lead to unwanted exposure or misuse of personal information.

- **Limited User Control Over Content**: Fitbit reserves the right to alter or remove user content at its discretion, which may limit users' control over their own data and how it is represented on the platform.

- **Accountability for Security Breaches**: Users are held responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials, which could lead to potential security risks if their account is compromised.

- **Age Restrictions**: The service restricts access for individuals under 13, but does not clearly outline how parental consent is verified, potentially exposing minors to privacy risks.

- **Lack of Clarity on Data Retention**: The Terms do not specify how long Fitbit retains user data or under what circumstances it may be deleted, raising concerns about long-term data storage and privacy.

- **Potential for Unauthorized Data Harvesting**: The Terms prohibit users from collecting information about others, yet the vague language could allow for loopholes that may enable data harvesting practices.
